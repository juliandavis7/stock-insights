# Project Activity Log

## Current Session - 2025-01-XX

### User Prompt Received
User wants to develop the compare page for the application and requests to refer to instructions within `docs/ui/compare_guide.md`.

### Context from Previous Work
- Successfully moved search functionality from dashboard to standalone `/search` route
- Fixed Convex environment variable issues by removing unnecessary dependencies
- Set up basic navigation structure with navbar
- All main routes are configured: search, compare, earnings, filings, projections, financials

### Current Task
Develop the compare page functionality according to specifications in compare_guide.md

### Actions Completed
1. ✅ Read docs/prd.md for complete project understanding
2. ✅ Read docs/ui/compare_guide.md for specific compare page requirements  
3. ✅ Implemented compare page functionality with proper HTML IDs
4. ✅ Updated activity log with completion details

### Implementation Details

#### Features Implemented
- **3-stock comparison interface** modeled after Search page
- **Real-time API integration** using existing `/metrics` endpoint
- **Color-coded performance highlighting** (green background for best performers)
- **Responsive design** with mobile-friendly layout
- **Error handling** with individual stock error states
- **Loading states** with skeleton components
- **Auto-fetch** on page load with default stocks (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL)

#### HTML IDs Implemented (as per system requirements)
- `compare-stock-selection-container` - Main stock selection container
- `compare-stock-inputs-row` - Row containing the 3 input fields

- Include stock selection with 3 input fields (IDs: compare-stock-input-1, compare-stock-input-2, compare-stock-input-3)
- Display metrics comparison table (ID: compare-metrics-results-table)
- Use same metrics as Search page: Gross Margin, Net Margin, P/E ratios, Growth rates, etc.
- Add color coding for best/worst performers
- Use existing `/api/v1/metrics?ticker={symbol}` endpoint with 3 simultaneous calls

### Files to be Modified
- `/app/routes/compare.tsx` - Main compare page implementation
- Potentially other supporting files as needed

### User Feedback Received
User requests two adjustments:
1. Reorder metrics to match Search page order exactly
2. Remove green highlighting behavior from comparison cells

### Actions Completed
1. ✅ Updated metric order in compare.tsx to match search page exactly
2. ✅ Removed green background highlighting from MetricRow component  
3. ✅ Updated activity log with changes
4. ✅ Cleaned up unused highlighting logic functions

### Changes Made
- **Metric Order**: Reordered all metrics to match Search page sequence:
  1. TTM PE → Forward PE → 2 Year Forward PE
  2. TTM EPS Growth → Current Yr Exp EPS Growth → Next Year EPS Growth  
  3. TTM Rev Growth → Current Yr Exp Rev Growth → Next Year Rev Growth
  4. Gross Margin → Net Margin
  5. TTM P/S Ratio → Forward P/S Ratio

- **Metric Labels**: Updated labels to match Search page exactly:
  - "Current Yr Exp EPS Growth" (instead of "Current Year EPS Growth")
  - "TTM Rev Growth" (instead of "TTM Revenue Growth")
  - "Current Yr Exp Rev Growth" (instead of "Current Year Revenue Growth")
  - "Next Year Rev Growth" (instead of "Next Year Revenue Growth")

- **Visual Changes**: 
  - Removed all green highlighting from comparison cells
  - All cells now use standard "py-3 px-4" styling
  - Removed getBestPerformer function and related highlighting logic
  - Table maintains clean, professional appearance without color coding

### Implementation Status
Compare page now fully matches Search page styling and metric presentation order.

## New User Request - Metric Grouping

### User Prompt Received
User wants metrics grouped into 4 separate bubbles (Card components) for both search and compare pages:
- **Group 1**: TTM PE, Forward PE, 2 Year Forward PE
- **Group 2**: TTM EPS Growth, Current Yr Exp EPS Growth, Next Year EPS Growth  
- **Group 3**: TTM Rev Growth, Current Yr Exp Rev Growth, Next Year Rev Growth
- **Group 4**: Gross Margin, Net Margin, TTM P/S Ratio, Forward P/S Ratio

### Actions Planned
1. Update search.tsx to split metrics into 4 separate Card components
2. Update compare.tsx to split metrics into 4 separate Card components  
3. Maintain existing HTML IDs and styling consistency
4. Update activity log with implementation details

### Actions Completed
1. ✅ Updated search.tsx to split metrics into 4 separate Card components with proper groupings
2. ✅ Updated compare.tsx to split metrics into 4 separate Card components with proper groupings
3. ✅ Maintained existing HTML IDs and styling consistency
4. ✅ Updated activity log with implementation details

### Implementation Details

#### Metrics Grouping Structure
Both search and compare pages now display metrics in 4 separate Card components:

**Group 1 - P/E Ratios:**
- TTM PE
- Forward PE  
- 2 Year Forward PE

**Group 2 - EPS Growth:**
- TTM EPS Growth
- Current Yr Exp EPS Growth
- Next Year EPS Growth

**Group 3 - Revenue Growth:**
- TTM Rev Growth
- Current Yr Exp Rev Growth
- Next Year Rev Growth

**Group 4 - Margins & Ratios:**
- Gross Margin
- Net Margin
- TTM P/S Ratio
- Forward P/S Ratio

#### Technical Changes Made
- **Search Page**: Split single metrics table into 4 separate Card components with individual table IDs (search-pe-ratios-table, search-eps-growth-table, search-revenue-growth-table, search-margins-ratios-table)
- **Compare Page**: Split single comparison table into 4 separate Card components with individual table IDs (compare-pe-ratios-table, compare-eps-growth-table, compare-revenue-growth-table, compare-margins-ratios-table)
- **Consistent Styling**: Each group uses Card, CardHeader, CardTitle structure with proper overflow handling
- **Maintained Functionality**: All existing MetricRow components and formatting functions remain unchanged

### Files Modified
- `/app/routes/search.tsx` - Split single table into 4 grouped tables ✅
- `/app/routes/compare.tsx` - Split single table into 4 grouped tables ✅

## Additional UI Refinements - 2025-01-XX

### User Requests Received
User requested additional changes to clean up the UI:
1. Remove column headers (metric, value, benchmark range) and display only row values
2. Remove grouping headers (P/E Ratios, EPS Growth, etc.)
3. Remove middle bubble showing stock names
4. Move compare button to right of ticker inputs
5. Align metric rows vertically with consistent column widths
6. Remove Stock 1/2/3 labels from compare page inputs

### Actions Completed
1. ✅ Removed all table headers from metric tables in both pages
2. ✅ Removed CardHeader and CardTitle from all metric group Cards
3. ✅ Removed stock name display bubbles (AAPL STOCK METRICS, comparison header)
4. ✅ Repositioned compare button to right of inputs using flexbox layout
5. ✅ Added consistent column width classes: w-1/3 for search page (3 columns), w-1/5 for compare page (5 columns)
6. ✅ Removed Stock 1/2/3 Label components from compare page inputs

### Technical Implementation Details
- **Column Alignment**: Applied Tailwind width classes (w-1/3, w-1/5) to ensure consistent column widths across all metric tables
- **Layout Improvements**: Used flexbox (`flex flex-col md:flex-row`) for compare form with `flex-1` for inputs and `shrink-0` for button
- **Cleaner UI**: Removed unnecessary labels and headers to create minimal, focused interface
- **Consistent Spacing**: Maintained `py-3 px-4` padding for all table cells

### Files Modified
