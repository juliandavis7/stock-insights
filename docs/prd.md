**User Input Fields (for each projection year 2026-2029):**
- Revenue growth rate (%) - Range: -50% to +100%
- Net income growth rate (%) - Range: -100% to +200%  
- Net income margin (%) - Range: 0% to 50%
- PE ratio low estimate - Range: 1 to 100
- PE ratio high estimate - Range: 1 to 200

**Calculated Outputs:**
- Projected revenue (absolute values)
- Projected net income (absolute values)
- Earnings per share (EPS)
- Stock price range (low/high)
- Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) range
- Implied market capitalization range
